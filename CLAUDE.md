## Development Guidelines

### Tool Usage
- **Use VS Code MCP tools confidently** - Don't ask for permission to use `mcp__vscode-mcp-server__*` tools. They are available and designed for this environment. Use them directly when appropriate for file operations, code analysis, and terminal commands.
- Refer to [.claude/vscode.md](.claude/vscode.md) for detailed VS Code tool usage patterns and when to prioritize IDE tools over manual commands.

### Communication Style
- **No permission-seeking** - Don't ask for validation before executing work. Execute directly and report results.
- Example: ❌ "Should I update this file?" → ✅ Just update it and report what was done.
- This keeps interactions efficient and focused on delivering results.
